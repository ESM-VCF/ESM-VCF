- As a *biologist*, I want to *extract time-series of biogeochemical NEMO outputs at the nearest grid node of a point-location of a ship track*, so that *I can compare it to observational data*.  

- As a *scientist (non-modeller)*, I want to *query and visualize model data from within my favorite GIS client/desktop application*, so that *I can work efficiently and keep using the tools that I'm already familiar with*.

- As a *sea-going observational oceanographer*, I want to *extract time series of NEMO data along possible ship tracks*, so that *I can get an overview of the temporal and spatial structure of the water masses that helps planning my measurement strategy*.
